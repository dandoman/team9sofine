Welcome to Team 9's awesome project

Back End

What you need:

* Java 8 - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* Maven - https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
* Postgres - http://www.postgresql.org/download/

Getting set up:

1) Start your postgres database 
2) In src/main/resources, use the two scripts to create the database, user and tables. Must be run manually at the moment.

Running during normal development: 

*All of the following are to be run from the project root directory*

'mvn spring-boot:run' - will run the back end on post 8080
'mvn package' - will build the fat jar with the embedded tomcat server
Once the fat jar is built, can run using 'java -jar ${jarName}'

While the service is running, you can see some basic back end swagger API documentation at 'http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs'
